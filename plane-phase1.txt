AI Chatbot App: Phase 1 Analysis & Recommendations
===============================================

‚úÖ Current Features
------------------
- Google OAuth authentication (NextAuth.js)
- Personalized, modern UI (user name, welcome message, branding)
- Together AI integration for chat completions
- Longer responses (increased max_tokens)
- Client-side chat state (ephemeral, per session)
- Testing infrastructure (Jest, React Testing Library)

üö© Missing Features for Robustness
---------------------------------
1. Error Handling & User Feedback
   - Graceful error messages for API/network issues
   - Loading indicators for slow responses
   - Handling rate limits or API quota errors
2. Input Validation & Abuse Prevention
   - Limit message length and frequency (rate limiting)
   - Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks
3. Session Management
   - Option to clear/reset chat
   - Warn users about ephemeral chat history
4. Accessibility & UX
   - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
   - Focus management (auto-focus input after sending)
   - Responsive design for mobile/tablet
5. User Experience Enhancements
   - Streaming responses (show tokens as they arrive, like ChatGPT)
   - ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù button if output is cut off
   - Message timestamps
   - User avatar (from Google profile)
   - Option to download or copy chat history
6. Security
   - Ensure API keys are never exposed to the client
   - Secure all API endpoints (already done with NextAuth)
7. Testing & Monitoring
   - More tests: integration, edge cases, error states
   - Logging for errors and usage (for debugging and analytics)
8. Performance
   - Debounce input to prevent accidental double sends
   - Optimize rendering for long chat histories

‚≠êÔ∏è Recommendations for Phase 1
------------------------------
1. Improve Error Handling
   - Show user-friendly error messages if the AI API fails or is slow.
   - Add a retry option for failed requests.
2. Add Streaming Support (Advanced, but great UX)
   - Show the AI‚Äôs response as it‚Äôs generated, not all at once.
3. Enhance UX
   - Add a ‚ÄúClear Chat‚Äù button.
   - Show a warning that chat history is not saved.
   - Add message timestamps.
4. Accessibility
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible.
   - Add ARIA labels where appropriate.
5. Testing
   - Add tests for error states, loading, and authentication flows.
